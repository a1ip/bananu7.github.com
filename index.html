<h2>Yeah it's me</h2>
I hopefully will convert this mess into something that might actually
resemble a blog. After ditching Wordpress and a few other "sites" I
won't ever mention, Jekyll looks like a reasonable way to do that.

<h2>Current Posts so far</h2>
There aren't many so far, and I figure it's better if it's available
in lousy form than not available at all.

<ul>
{% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
